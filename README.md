## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- A small validation library I created in a previous project

### What I learned

I learned how to manage basic forms with react and show accessible labels and validation messages.

### Continued development

I want to learn managing more complex forms with more complex inputs as well as handling form submission.

### Useful resources

- [A guide from MDN on structuring forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/How_to_structure_a_web_form) - A good starting point if you are not familiar with forms yet.
